# Distributing Assignments

<!-- The documentation for Otter Assign is forked from the docs for jassign: https://github.com/okpy/jassign/blob/master/docs/notebook-format.md -->

Otter ships with an assignment development and distribution tool called Otter Assign, an Otter-compliant fork of [jassign](https://github.com/okpy/jassign) that was designed for OkPy. Otter Assign allows instructors to create assignments by writing questions, prompts, solutions, and public and private tests all in a single notebook, which is then parsed and broken down into student and autograder versions.

## Notebook Format

Otter's notebook format groups prompts, solutions, and tests together into prompts. Autograder tests are specified as cells in the notebook and their output is used as the expected output of the autograder when genreating tests. Each question has metadata, expressed in a code block in YAML format when the question is declared. Tests generated by Otter Assign follow the [Otter-compliant OK format](test_files.md).

**Note:** Otter Assign is also backwards-compatible with jassign-formatted notebooks. To use jassign format with Otter Assign, specify the `--jassign` flag in your call to `otter assign`. While the formats are very similar, jassign's format has some key differences to the Otter Assign format, and many of the behaviors described below, e.g. intercell seeding, are not compatible with jassign format. For more information about formatting notebooks for jassign, see [its documentation](https://github.com/okpy/jassign/blob/master/docs/notebook-format.md).

### Assignment Metadata

In addition to various command line arugments discussed below, Otter Assign also allows you to specify various assignment generation arguments in an assignment metadata cell. These are very similar to the question metadata cells described in the next section. Assignment metadata, included by convention as the first cell of the notebook, places YAML-formatted configurations inside a code block that begins with `BEGIN ASSIGNMENT`:

````
```
BEGIN ASSIGNMENT
init_cell: false
export_cell: true
...
```
````

This cell is removed from both output notebooks. These configurations, listed in the table below, can be **overwritten** by their command line counterparts (e.g. `init_cell: true` is overwritten by the `--no-init-cell` flag). The options, their defaults (converted to Python data types), and descriptions are listed in the following table. Any unspecified keys will keep their default values. For more information about many of these arguments, see the [Usage and Output section](#usage-and-output).

| Key | Default Value | Description |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| `init_cell` | `True` | Whether or not to include an Otter initialization cell |
| `export_cell` | `True` | Whether or not to include a PDF generation cell |
| `filtering` | `True` | Whether or not the output PDF should be filtered |
| `instructions` | `''` | Additional submission instructions to be placed just before the PDF export cell |
| `check_all_cell` | `True` | Whether or not to include an `otter.Notebook.check_all` cell |
| `run_tests` | `True` | Whether or not to run tests on the autograder notebook |
| `solutions_pdf` | `False` | Whether to generate a solutions PDF from notebook; either `true`, `false`, or `filtered`; defaults to unfiltered PDF |
| `generate` | `False` | Either a list of arguments for Otter Generate or whether or not Otter Generate should be called on the output |
| `files` | `[]` | A list of support files required either for students or Otter Generate |

A note about Otter Generate: the `generate` key of the assignment metadata has two forms. If you just want to generate and require no additional arguments, set `generate: true` in the YAML and Otter Assign will simply run `otter generate` from the autograder directory (this will also include any files passed to `files`). If you require additional arguments, e.g. `points` or `show_results`, then set `generate` to a nested dictionary of these parameters and their values:

```
generate:
    seed: 42
    show_results: true
```

These values, if left unspecified, take on the default values of their flags as described below and in [Otter Generate](otter_generate.md).

As an example, the following assignment metadata includes an export cell but no filtering, not init cell, and calls Otter Generate with the flags `--points 3 --seed 0`.

````
```
BEGIN ASSIGNMENT
filtering: false
init_cell: false
generate:
    points: 3
    seed: 0
```
````

### Autograded Questions

Here is an example question in an Otter Assign-formatted notebook:

![](images/assign_sample_question.png)

For code questions, a question is a description *Markdown* cell, followed by a solution *code* cell and zero or more test *code* cells. The description cell must contain a code block (enclosed in triple backticks <code>\`\`\`</code>) that begins with `BEGIN QUESTION` on its own line, followed by YAML that defines metadata associated with the question.

The rest of the code block within the description cell must be YAML-formatted with the following fields (in any order):

* `name` (required) - a string identifier that is a legal file name (without an extension)
* `manual` (optional) - a boolean (default `False`); whether to include the response cell in a PDF for manual grading
* `points` (optional) - a number (default `1`); how many points the question is worth

As an example, the question metadata below indicates an autograded question `q1` worth 1 point.

````
```
BEGIN QUESTION
name: q1
manual: false
```
````

Solution cells contain code formatted in such a way that the assign parser replaces lines or portions of lines with prespecified prompts. Otter uses the same solution replacement rules as jassign. From the [jassign docs](https://github.com/okpy/jassign/blob/master/docs/notebook-format.md):

* A line ending in `# SOLUTION` will be replaced by `...`, properly indented. If
  that line is an assignment statement, then only the expression(s) after the
  `=` symbol will be replaced.
* A line ending in `# SOLUTION NO PROMPT` will be removed.
* A line `# BEGIN SOLUTION` or `# BEGIN SOLUTION NO PROMPT` must be paired with
  a later line `# END SOLUTION`. All lines in between are replaced with `...` or
  removed completely in the case of `NO PROMPT`.
* A line `""" # BEGIN PROMPT` must be paired with a later line `""" # END
  PROMPT`. The contents of this multiline string (excluding the `# BEGIN
  PROMPT`) appears in the student cell. Single or double quotes are allowed.
  Optionally, a semicolon can be used to suppress output: `"""; # END PROMPT`

#### Solution Removal Examples

```python
def square(x):
    y = x * x # SOLUTION NO PROMPT
    return y # SOLUTION

nine = square(3) # SOLUTION
```

would be presented to students as

```python
def square(x):
    ...

nine = ...
```

And

```python
pi = 3.14
if True:
    # BEGIN SOLUTION
    radius = 3
    area = radius * pi * pi
    # END SOLUTION
    print('A circle with radius', radius, 'has area', area)
def circumference(r):
    # BEGIN SOLUTION NO PROMPT
    return 2 * pi * r
    # END SOLUTION
    """ # BEGIN PROMPT
    # Next, define a circumference function.
    pass
    """; # END PROMPT
```

would be presented to students as

```python
pi = 3.14
if True:
    ...
    print('A circle with radius', radius, 'has area', area)
def circumference(r):
    # Next, define a circumference function.
    pass
```

The test cells are any code cells following the solution cell that begin with the comment `## Test ##` or `## Hidden Test ##` (case insensitive). A `Test` is distributed to students so that they can validate their work. A `Hidden Test` is not distributed to students, but is used for scoring their work.

**Note:** Currently, the conversion to OK format does not handle multi-line tests if any line but the last one generates output. So, if you want to print
twice, make two separate test cells instead of a single cell with:

```python
print(1)
print(2)
```

#### Intercell Seeding

Otter assign maintains support for [intercell seeding](seeding.md) by allowing seed cells to be placed between question cells and solution cells. To create a seed cell, put `## Seed ##` (case insensitive) on the first line of a code cell between the two. This allows instructors to write code with deterministic output, with which hidden tests can be generated. Consider the following example:

![](images/assign_intercell_seeding.png)

Note that seed cells are removed in student and autograder outputs, so any results in those notebooks may be different from the provided tests. The intent of removing the seed from the autograder notebook is to keep the value of the seed secure, so that if this notebook is released as assignment solutions, the security of the hidden tests is maintained. However, when grading, seeds are executed between each cell, so if you are using seeds, make sure to use **the same seed** every time and that you have a seed cell before **each** code cell, to ensure that seeding before every cell won't affect your tests.

### Manually Graded Questions

Otter Assign also supports manually-graded questions using a similar specification to the one described above. To indicate a manually-graded question, set `manual: true` in the question metadata. A manually-graded question is defined by three parts:

* A question cell with metadata
* (Optionally) a prompt cell
* A solution cell

Manually-graded solution cells have two formats:

* If a code cell, they can be delimited by solution removal syntax as above.
* If a Markdown cell, the start of at least one line must match the regex `(<strong>|\*{2})solution:?(<\/strong>|\*{2})`.

The latter means that as long as one of the lines in the cell starts with `SOLUTION` (case insensitive, with or without a colon `:`) in boldface, the cell is considered a solution cell. If there is a prompt cell for manually-graded questions (i.e. a cell between the question cell and solution cell), then this prompt is included in the output. If none is present, Otter Assign automatically adds a Markdown cell with the contents `_Type your answer here, replacing this test._`.

Manually graded questions are automatically enclosed in `<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->` and `<!-- END QUESTION -->` tags by Otter Assign so that only these questions are exported to the PDF when filtering is turned on (the default). In the autograder notebook, this includes the question cell, prompt cell, and solution cell. In the student notebook, this includes only the question and prompt cells. The `<!-- END QUESTION -->` tag is automatically inserted at the top of the next cell if it is a Markdown cell or in a new Markdown cell before the next cell if it is not.

An example of a manually-graded code question:

![](images/assign_sample_code_manual.png)

An example of a manually-graded written question (with no prompt):

![](images/assign_sample_written_manual.png)

An example of a manuall-graded written question with a custom prompt:

## Usage and Output

Otter Assign is called using the `otter assign` command. This command takes in two required arguments.

```

                        after publishing grades (incl. hidden tests); use with
                        --generate only
```

The first is `master`, the path to the master notebook (the one formatted as described above), and the second is `result`, the path at which output shoud be written. The optional `files` argument takes an arbitrary number of paths to files that should be shipped with notebooks (e.g. data files, images, Python executables).

The default behavior of Otter Assign is to do the following:

1. Filter test cells from the master notebook and write these to test files
2. Add Otter initialization, export, and `Notebook.check_all` cells
3. Clear outputs and write questions (with metadata hidden), prompts, and solutions to a notebook in a new `autograder` directory
4. Write *all* tests to `autograder/tests`
5. Copy autograder notebook with solutions removed into a new `student` directory
6. Write *public* tests to `student/tests`
7. Copy `files` into `autograder` and `student` directories
8. Run all tests in `autograder/tests` on the solutions notebook to ensure they pass
9. (If `--generate` is passed,) generate a Gradescope autograder zipfile from the `autograder` directory

The behaviors described in step 2 can be overridden using the optional arguments described in the help specification.

**An important note:** make sure that you *run all cells* in the master notebook and save it *with the outputs* so that Otter Assign can generate the test files based on these outputs. The outputs will be cleared in the copies generated by Otter Assign.

For more information about the commands linked to `--generate`, see the documentation for [Otter Generate](otter_generate.md).

### Export Formats and Flags

By default, Otter Assign adds an initialization cell at the *top* of the notebook with the contents

```python
# Initialize Otter
import otter
grader = otter.Notebook()
```

To prevent this behavior, add the `--no-init-cell` flag.

Otter Assign also automatically adds a check-all cell and an export cell to the end of the notebook. The check-all cells consist of a Markdown cell:

```
To double-check your work, the cell below will rerun all of the autograder tests.
```

and a code cell that calls `otter.Notebook.check_all`:

```python
grader.check_all()
```

The export cells consist of a Markdown cell:

```
## Submission

Make sure you have run all cells in your notebook in order before running the cell below, so that all images/graphs appear in the output. **Please save before submitting!**
```

and a code cell that calls `otter.Notebook.export` with HTML comment filtering:

```python
# Save your notebook first, then run this cell to export.
grader.export("/path/to/notebook.ipynb")
```

To prevent the inclusion of a check-all cell, use the `--no-check-all` flag. To prevent cell filtering in the export cell, use the `--no-filter` flag. To remove the export cells entirely, use the `--no-export-cell` tag. If you have custom instructions for submission that you want to add to the export cell, pass them to the `--instructions` flag.

**Note:** Otter Assign currently only supports [HTML comment filtering](pdfs.md). This means that if you have other cells you want included in the export, you must delimit them using HTML comments, not using cell tags.

### Otter Assign Example

Consider the directory stucture below, where `hw00/hw00.ipynb` is an Otter Assign-formatted notebook.

```
| hw00
  | - hw00.ipynb
  | - data.csv
```

To generate the distribution versions of `hw00.ipynb` (after `cd`ing into `hw00`), I would run

```
otter assign hw00.ipynb dist
```

This will create a new folder called `dist` with `autograder` and `student` as subdirectories, as described above.

```
| hw00
  | - hw00.ipynb
  | - data.csv
  | dist
    | autograder
      | - hw00.ipynb
      | tests
        | - q1.py
        | - q2.py
        ...
    | student
      | - hw00.ipynb
      | tests
        | - q1.py
        | - q2.py
        ...
```

If I had wanted to include `data.csv` in the distribution folders, I would change my call to

```
otter assign hw00.ipynb dist data.csv
```

The resulting directory structure would be:

```
| hw00
  | - hw00.ipynb
  | - data.csv
  | dist
    | autograder
      | - data.csv
      | - hw00.ipynb
      | tests
    | student
      | - data.csv
      | - hw00.ipynb
      | tests
```

In generating the distribution versions, I can prevent Otter Assign from rerunning the tests using the `--no-run-tests` flag:

```
otter assign --no-run-tests hw00.ipynb dist data.csv
```

If I wanted no initialization cell and no cell filtering in the export cell, I would run

```
otter assign --no-init-cell --no-filtering hw00.ipynb dist data.csv
```

And if I wanted a Gradescope autograder with a seed of 42, I would run

```
otter assign --generate --seed 42 hw00.ipynb dist data.csv
```
