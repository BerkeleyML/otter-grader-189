Otter comes with a few built-in plugins to optionally extend its own functionality. These plugins are documented here. **Note:** To use these plugins, specify the importable names _exactly_ as seen here (i.e. `otter.plugins.builtin.GoogleSheetsGradeOverride`, not `otter.plugins.builtin.grade_override.GoogleSheetsGradeOverride`).
