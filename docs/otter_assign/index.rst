   usage

Otter ships with an assignment development and distribution tool called Otter Assign, an 
Otter-compliant fork of `jAssign <https://github.com/okpy/jassign>`_ that was designed for OkPy. 
Otter Assign allows instructors to create assignments by writing questions, prompts, solutions, and 
public and private tests all in a single notebook, which is then parsed and broken down into student 
and autograder versions.
